My old friend, Donya, passed away.

Did you know her?

163

Yes.

164
00:11:09,917 --> 00:11:12,292
I would like to pay my last respects.

165
00:11:12,917 --> 00:11:14,792
Do you know where her funeral will be?

166
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,375
It's starting to feel like a dead end.

They're very bad. Not to be trusted.

What do you mean?

179
00:12:12,917 --> 00:12:14,208
For five years,

180
00:12:14,292 --> 00:12:18,792
people have been welcomed into countries
that have kept them out using barbwire.

181
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,708
There were houses and jobs.

182
00:12:21,292 --> 00:12:24,167
Folks were happy to have people around
to help them rebuild.

183
00:12:25,167 --> 00:12:27,167
It wasn't just
one community coming together,

184
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,292
it was the entire world coming together.

185
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,792
And then, boom.

186
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:34,125
Just like that, it goes right back
to the way it used to be.

187
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,417
To them, at least Karli's doin' somethin'.

188
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,083
You really think
her ends justify her means?

189
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:41,958
Then, she's no different than him
or anybody else we've fought.

190
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:43,292
She's different.

191
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,500
She's not motivated by the same things.

192
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,125
That little girl.

193

194

lurking outside right now.

Take it easy. Don't engage him.

204

He's just gonna extort you
and do that stupid head tilt thing.

as it is to hear a friendly voice,

So, you don't wanna go into this blind.

Sharon, listen, I know I owe you already,

218

Do you think I'm makin' a mistake
making more of us?

234
00:15:14,542 --> 00:15:18,500
My grandfather, Lukasz,
he was a World War II resistance fighter.

235
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:19,708
He always used to tell me,

236
00:15:19,792 --> 00:15:22,167
"If you're doing somethin',
and it makes you scared,

"it's probably because
it's the right thing."

238
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,917
And he fought Nazis, so...

239
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,167
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Seems like good advice.

240
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,500
You know, when I was a kid,
I was actually a Captain America fan.

241
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:37,042
I don't know if I should
tease you about that yet or not.

242
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:41,208
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY) He made me believe that
there was decent people in this world.

I didn't think there could be another
Captain America until I met you.

there was just good and bad,

but the world's more complicated now.
People are lost.

They need a leader who looks like them,
who understands their pain.

Someone who understands
that today's heroes

don't have the luxury
of keeping their hands clean.

the legacy of that shield.

That shield is a monument to a bygone era.

A reminder of all the people

High risk of casualties.

we'll move in fast. Take her by surprise.

Look, the person closest to her died,
she's vulnerable.

271
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,167
Now is the best time to reason with her.

272
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,750
What? No. Wait, no!
No! Stop. Hold on. Stop, okay?

273
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:22,208
I think we're way past reasoning with her,

unless you forgot that she blew up
a building with people still in it.

Sam, you walk in there cold,
she could kill you.
